# lind-wasm-apps
Various WebAssembly (WASM) application builds intended for use with Lind-Wasm.

This repository contains example and utility applications (benchmarks, demos, etc.) that integrate with the Lind runtime environment to showcase capabilities, facilitate testing, and serve as starting points for WASM-based development.

Lind is a platform for running WASM applications in a secure, sandboxed environment. The lind-wasm-apps project exists to:

- Provide realistic examples of applications compiled to WASM for use in Lind.

- Offer benchmarks and performance tests to validate and stress-test Lind’s runtime.

- Serve as reference implementations or scaffolding for developers building their own WASM apps targeting Lind.
